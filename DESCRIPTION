Description: CODATA internationally recommended values of the fundamental physical
    constants, provided as symbols for direct use within the R language. Optionally,
    the values with errors and/or the values with units are also provided if the
    'errors' and/or the 'units' packages are installed. The Committee on Data
    for Science and Technology (CODATA) is an interdisciplinary committee of the
    International Council for Science which periodically provides the internationally
    accepted set of values of the fundamental physical constants. This package
    contains the "2018 CODATA" version, published on May 2019:
